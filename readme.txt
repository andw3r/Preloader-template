Name: Preloader template

Description: Need to implement the web-site preloader with minimal code footprint.
             The preloader must have the two states: "Loading ..." and "Fetching ..." with animated dots.
             "Loading" stage timeout - 5s, "Fetching" stage timeout - 5s.
             After the Loading and Fetching stages - show a simple "Hello world" page.

Files:
- index.html       - target file (must include all HTML, CSS and JS). You have to create it.
- Hitech-Color.svg - logo in the SVG format

Requirements:
- small size (to increase the load speed of view for user)
- desktop and mobile screens support
- local code usage (use only HTML, CSS and JS implemented in preloader scope)
- do not use external sources (only pure HTML, CSS and JS)
- built-in the logo into the HTML code (logo in CSV format)

Expected results: 
 - index.html with implemented preloader
